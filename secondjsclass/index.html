      <!-- DATATYPES -->
      <!-- 
        1. String - They are written with quotes.
        2. Number- Numabers are digits written with or without decimals
        3. Boolean- Boolean has two values true or false
        4. Array - > This is an entity with a single value that is capable of storing different data types.
        Array are stored in square brackets
        5. Undefined-> not defined
        6. Object -> written with curly brackets {}
